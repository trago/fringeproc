 * space build with the components.
 *
 * Here we have the reference to differences in x- and y-direction. It gives
 * the flexibility to update these fields outside the class. For example, we
 * can ask a pixel to objects of this class, process data, update
 * the x- and y-direction fields and in the following pixel asking it will
 * use the updated fields automatically.
